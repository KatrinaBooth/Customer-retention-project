<!-- ABOUT THE PROJECT -->
## About The Project

This project is the final assignment for the discrete modelling section of the Predictive Modelling module at Digital Futures Academy. Over 2.5 days, I used logistic regression & random forests to analyse churn in a customer database, identify retention drivers, prioritize at-risk customers, and provide churn likelihood scores.

The following deliverables were expected:

* My team's information presentation deck.
* A list of top 500 most likely to churn customers.
* My notebook presenting my team's work. This should include my EDA, Feature Engineering, Split, Modelling & Model Evaluation. 
* Full list of churn risk/probability for the remaining customers.
