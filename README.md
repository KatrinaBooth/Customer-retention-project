<!-- ABOUT THE PROJECT -->
## About The Project

This project, completed as part of the discrete modelling section of the Predictive Modelling module at Digital Futures Academy, focused on analyzing customer churn behavior and identifying retention strategies. I used logistic regression to analyse churn in a customer database, identify retention drivers, prioritize at-risk customers, and provide churn likelihood scores.

<!-- Deliverables -->
## Deliverables

* An information presentation deck.
* A list of top 500 most likely to churn customers.
* A notebook presenting all work. This should include my EDA, Feature Engineering, Split, Modelling & Model Evaluation. 
* A full list of churn likelihood for the remaining customers.

<!-- Outcomes -->
## Outcomes

* Overall, the churned customers are female, have no partners or dependents, and have opted only for services related to phones.
* Senior citizens are more likely to churn whilst customers with dependents or partners are less likely to churn.
* Customers who sign up for online security services are more likely to stay.
* Customers with 0-5 months tenure show the highest churn proportion (~40%), indicating early-stage churn is a major issue.

<!-- Conclusion -->
## Conclusion

This project provided comprehensive analysis of customer churn for Swan Teleco. By identifying key churn drivers, such as contract types and service usage patterns, and highlighting at-risk customer segments, we created a solid foundation for effective retention strategies. The predictive models and ranked customer lists enable targeted interventions, while the recommendations for promoting long-term contracts and enhancing customer experience address critical areas for improvement. These outcomes demonstrate the potential of analytics to transform raw data into meaningful strategies that support customer retention and business growth.
